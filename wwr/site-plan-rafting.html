    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose for this site is to build revenue in my new white water rafting business. 
    We are currently a brick and mortar company only. We are using this site to expand our 
    audience and make it easier for our customers to reserve equipment and navigate all the 
    products that we have to offer.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target customers are middle to upper class clients. The products we provide are 
    mostly geared toward teenager and older groups. We do have some products available for 
    family outings, but the majority of our clientele tend to be the former described. They 
    are coming to our site to find equipment rentals and to book our guides for their trips. 
    Currently, customer needs in our area can only be met by coming into our location or 
    through phonecalls. The website will lighten the booking load on our staff so they can 
    better attend to guests in person. While we would like customers to be able to access and 
    navigate our site effectively from all sources, we are primarily concerned with cell phone 
    access. We see this as being our customer's primary mode of booking. If the site is as 
    successful as we hope, we plan to develop an app.</p>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>

      The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
      offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
      Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
      Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
