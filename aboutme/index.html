    <h2>(Reesa)</h2>
    <p>I am a single Mom of three amazing children. I homeschool the younger two and am working with my older son to pursue his career in Electrical Engineering. I am a passionate entrepreneur, seamstress, and writer of children's books and historical fiction. In my spare time I enjoy working on my businesses and/or sewing. I have a degree in FACS Education from BYU-Provo. I am changing careers to become a Software Developer. I'm excited about the skills i get to learn through this degree to build my business and eventually be able to work from home. I am also passionate about music. I sing and play the french horn. When I grow up, I want to learn how to play the piano, too. My children play cello, violin, and piano for now. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my entire life. My parents grew up RLDS and were converted and baptized months before my birth. Even though we lived in Missouri, we drove all the way out to Provo to be sealed when I was around 1. My favorite scripture is, "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know he giveth no commandment unto the children of men, save he prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. (1Neph.3:7) This scripture has always come to me often as I face challenging life decisions. I comfort myself remembering if God is directing me to do it, He will provide a way for me to succeed. God has proven this to me over and over again and my knowledge of His love and constant guidance is unshaken as a result.</p>
